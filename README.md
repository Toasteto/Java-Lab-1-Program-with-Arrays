2.16 Lab 1: Remove all even numbers from an array
Write the removeEvens() method, which receives an array of integers as a parameter and returns a new array of integers containing only the odd numbers from the original array. The main program outputs values of the returned array.

Hint: If the original array has even numbers, then the new array will be smaller in length than the original array and should have no blank elements.

Ex: If the array passed to the removeEvens() method is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], then the method returns and the program output is:

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Ex: If the array passed to the removeEvens() method is [1, 9, 3], then the method returns and the program output is:

[1, 9, 3]
